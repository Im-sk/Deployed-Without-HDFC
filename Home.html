      <p>HDFS is a distributed file system that handles large data sets running on commodity hardware. It is used to scale a single Apache Hadoop cluster to hundreds (and even thousands) of nodes. HDFS is one of the major components of Apache Hadoop, the others being MapReduce and YARN. HDFS should not be confused with or replaced by Apache HBase, which is a column-oriented non-relational database management system that sits on top of HDFS and can better support real-time data needs with its in-memory processing engine.</p>

	      <p><b>Namenode</b><br>
		The namenode is the commodity hardware that contains the GNU/Linux operating system and the namenode software. It is a software that can be run on commodity hardware. The system having the namenode acts as the master server and it does the following tasks −
		Manages the file system namespace.
		Regulates client’s access to files. It also executes file system operations such as renaming, closing, and opening files and directories.
	   <br><b>Datanode</b><br>
		The datanode is a commodity hardware having the GNU/Linux operating system and datanode software. For every node (Commodity hardware/System) in a cluster, there will be a datanode. These nodes manage the data storage of their system.
		Datanodes perform read-write operations on the file systems, as per client request.
		They also perform operations such as block creation, deletion, and replication according to the instructions of the namenode.</p>

      <h4><b>History</b></h4>
      <p>According to its co-founders, Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella, the genesis of Hadoop was the Google File System paper that was published in October 2003. This paper spawned another one from Google – "MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters". Development started on the Apache Nutch project, but was moved to the new Hadoop subproject in January 2006.[19] Doug Cutting, who was working at Yahoo! at the time, named it after his son's toy elephant. The initial code that was factored out of Nutch consisted of about 5,000 lines of code for HDFS and about 6,000 lines of code for MapReduce.

In March 2006, Owen O’Malley was the first committer to add to the Hadoop project; Hadoop 0.1.0 was released in April 2006. It continues to evolve through contributions that are being made to the project. The very first design document for the Hadoop Distributed File System was written by Dhruba Borthakur in 2007.</p>
